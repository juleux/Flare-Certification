        <h1>The Man</h1>
        <p>When were you born, and where did you grow up?</p>
        <p>I was born in 1925 in the country outside of Itta Bena, Mississippi, which is not too awful far from Indianola. My parents separated when I was around four, and I spent some time in the hills of Mississippi, up around Kilmichael. That’s where I lost my mother, when I was nine. I was a farmhand all of my life, until I was inducted into the Army and sent to Camp Shelby near Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in 1943. I was plowing, driving tractors and trucks, chopping cotton – everything that one does on a farm, I did some of it.</p>
        <p>What made you choose the guitar?</p>
        <p>I think that a lot of that has to do with the Sanctified Church, because this preacher played guitar in the church, and that was one thing. But also, guitars were kind of available. The average home had a guitar and a harmonica, usually; you could always find them around. But saxophones, trumpets, pianos, and things like that were rare. Only the middle class families would have a piano. Sometimes a lot of us would like to sneak in the church to play with the piano, and many of us got jobs as janitors, because this enabled us to be near it. We’d be cleaning up the church or something like that, and get a chance to fool with a piano a little bit.</p>
        <p>When did you begin playing professionally?</p>
        <p>In the middle 1940s, in Indianola, on the corner of Church and Second Street. Second Street is like the main part of town, and Church Street crossed it and went into the black area, what we called "across the tracks." I never passed the hat, but the people know that I’d appreciate a dime if I played a tune they’d requested.</p>
        <p>How did you acquire the name "B.B."?</p>
        <p>The idea came from the local radio station where I was working, WDIA. I was singing some advertisements for Pepticon, of these cure-all patent medicines. Later, when I became a disc jockey with my own one-hour show, they would call me "the blues boy," or "the boy form Beale Street." A lot of times they’d shorten it to B.B., and I like that, and it stuck with me all this time.</p>
        <p>"Three O’Clock Blues" was your first major R&amp;B hit. How did it change your life?</p>
        <p>I could go into the important theaters. As far as the black people were concerned, when you were getting into show business there were three places you had to go through to be acclaimed: the Howard Theater in Washington, D.C., the Royal Theater in Baltimore, and the Apollo Theater in New York. "Three O’Clock Blues" enabled me to go into these places, and it opened other areas, like one-nighters. I had been making about $85 a week with my playing and being on the radio and everything else I could do - $85 total – and when I recorded that first big hit, I started making $2500 a week. I didn’t get to keep all of it, but that was the guarantee.</p>
