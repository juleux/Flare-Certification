        <h1>The Music</h1>
        <p>Compared to many electric guitarists, you play few notes.</p>
        <p>I was at the Apollo Theater one time, and there was a critic there, and to me what he said was one of the great compliments that people have given me. The critic wrote: "B.B King sings, and then Lucille sings." That made me feel very good, because I do feel that I’m still singing when I play. That’s why I don’t play a lot of notes maybe like some people. Maybe that’s the reason why most of my music is very simple – that’s the way I sing. When I’m playing a solo, I hear me singing through the guitar.</p>
        <p>How did people like Django Reinhart and T-Bone Walker influence you?</p>
        <p>In the way they phrase. They still do it today. Even though they may be in different categories, even though some are jazz and some are blues, when I hear them phrase, each note to me seems to say something. And it doesn’t have to be 64 notes to a bar. Just one note sometimes seems to tell me a whole lot. So that’s one of the reasons why I like them. Same thing with Louis Jordan; even though he plays saxophone, the way he phrases seems to tell me something, and that can just stop me cold when I listen.</p>
        <p>Before you were nationally recognized, was there much contact between you and your contemporaries such as Muddy Waters? Were you aware of each other; did you have each other’s records and so forth?</p>
        <p>No. I had their records, but see, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and all of those guys were playing before me, and they didn’t know me from Adam. I was plowin’ when they was playin’ [laughs]! I liked them, and I imagine that they were aware of each other. But they didn’t know anything about me, no. Like Ike Turner was about 14 years old when I first met him, in Clarksdale, Mississippi. I had this great big band at that time, which consisted of my guitar, a set of drums, and a saxophone. That was a big band, wasn’t it? When Ike saw me [laughs], he said, "Oh man, you need help!"</p>
        <p>Did you invent the fingerstyle, perpendicular-to-the-neck vibrato?</p>
        <p>Let’s put it this way: I won’t say I invented it, but they weren’t doing it before I started [laughs]. I will say that I’m still trying. Bukka White and quite a few other people used bottlenecks. As I said, I got stupid fingers. They won’t work. If I get something like that in my hand and try to use it, it just won’t work. So my ears told me that when I trilled my hand, I’d get a sound similar to the sound they were getting with a bottleneck. And so for about 32 or 33 years I’ve been trying to do it, and now they tell me that I’m doing a little better.</p>
        <p>Do you read music?</p>
        <p>Reading music is what I call spellin’.  I spell; I read slowly. If the metronome is not goin’ too fast, I can do it pretty good.</p>
        <p>How long have you been using semi-solid, thin-body guitars?</p>
        <p>Since the first one I saw, about ’58. I have been using Gibson ES-355s for a long time because they’re stereo and I like the highs. I can’t hear lows too well – my ears don’t tell me much – but highs I can hear very well. My new guitar, which Gibson is planning to release as the Lucille model, is sort of like a 355 but with a few changes.</p>
        <p>How has it been modified?</p>
        <p>It has a closed body with no f-holes, so you don’t get the feedback. I used to have to put towels in my 355 to cut down the resonance, but with the new Lucille I can crank right up. Also, I can tune the tailpiece at the back. I usually wear sleeves most of the time, and on the other tailpiece, because of where the strings were wound, I always snagged my sleeves, or I’d wind up hurting my hand a little. With this one, my sleeve doesn’t get caught, and when I cup right on the bridge, it doesn’t hit the end of the windings, so I don’t hang up my sleeve and I don’t hurt my hand. Also, the neck is a little bit thinner.</p>
        <p>Of your own records, which ones do you think are the best? Any favorite solos?</p>
        <p>I’ve never made a perfect record, never. Although I’m not ashamed of any of them, there’s always something that I could have done better. I know the critics always mention Live And Well or Live At The Regal, but I think that Indianola Mississippi Seeds was the best album I’ve done artistically.</p>
