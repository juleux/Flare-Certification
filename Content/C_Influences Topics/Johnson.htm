        <h1>Lonnie Johnson</h1>
        <p>Like the blues itself, the birthdate of Alonzo "Lonnie" Johnson is not exactly known: it has been given as 1889, 1894, 1899 and 1900. What is known is that Johnson was born into a musical family in New Orleans and began playing in his father’s string band at age fourteen. Although he is remembered as a guitarist whose riffs would be echoed by jazz (Charlie Christian and Django Reinhart) and blues greats (T-Bone Walker and B.B. King), the violin was Lonnie’s primary instrument in his early years. After the influenza epidemic of 1918 wiped out much of Johnson’s family in New Orleans, he and his brother James moved to St. Louis where they played in Charlie Creath’s band, the Jazz-O-Matics. It was with this band that Johnson made his first recording, "Won’t Don’t Blues," in St. Louis, 1925. Two days later, Johnson appeared as leader on the first of some 130 sides he recorded for the Okeh label.</p>
        <p>Lonnie was first not only to improvise as a jazz guitartist, but to use the guitar as a "crying" counterpoint to lyrics, elaborated on by many blues guitarists, inspired by the playing of T-Bone Walker and B.B. King’s Lucille. Without sounding antiquated, Johnson continued to make music that was not so much unchanged as it was timeless up until his death in 1970.  Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top asked B.B. in an interview, "What were the first blues 78’s that knocked you out?" B.B. replyed, "My Aunt used to buy records like kids do today, and some of her collection was Blind Lemon and Lonnie Johnson. She had Robert Johnson, Bumble Bee Slim and Charlie Patton. I could just go on and name so many she had. But my favorites turned out to be Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson. I liked Robert and all the rest, but those were my favorites."(2)</p>
