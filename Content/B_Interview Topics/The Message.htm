        <h1>The Message</h1>
        <p>What do you do differently?</p>
        <p>It’s not just music. It’s kind of like a selling job, public relations. Sometimes audiences don’t pay attention unless you present it a certain way. No matter how good it is, you seem to need to put a catchy title on it. A lot of people, especially blacks, won’t like it if you call it blues, but if you go ahead and play it and call it a different name, they’ll like it. That’s the truth. So the blues are more important artistically, and also because I feel that I’ve got a message that should be heard.</p>
        <p>What’s your message?</p>
        <p>Well, here I am. I’m trying to work. I’m trying to bring people together. I’m trying to get people to see that we are our brother’s keeper. So there are many, many things that go along with it. I still work at it.</p>
        <p>Many people call you the King Of The Blues. Does that change your outlook on your work, or make you feel obligated in some way?</p>
        <p>Well, I guess I look at it both ways. First, I never think of myself as King Of The Blues; I happen to be a guy named B.B. King, and he plays the blues. Of course, I think I know my job pretty well. What keeps my feet on the ground is that there are people who haven’t had the popularity that I’ve had who are just as talented, or even more so, some of them. But I have so many young fans now, white and black, that come up to me. They trust me; they have faith. You know how it is when you do something and it’s appreciated by your girlfriend or your father or mother or whoever it may be. You can see it in their eyes. I can’t explain it; it’s a feeling that I can’t tell you about. You have to see for yourself to know. Maybe like your little brother or your daughter or your son, maybe even like your pet, your little puppy or something. When you look at them, there’s something that tells you – I know it seems a little deep, and it’s hard to explain – but you know that this pet or this person or whoever is really serious about what you’ve done.</p>
        <p>I wish I knew the words – now I’m really at a loss. You’re hurting when you can’t say what you really want, but there are times when no one else can tell you that they dig you like this special person can. This feeling has happened to me as a musician through the years. It’s made me think a lot of times when I go out on the stage and guys come up and want to play guitar with me. You can look in their eyes, the young musicians, and know that you have been something that’s going to help them go much further than probably what they would have without you. It’s like seeing your own children or your neighbor’s children. You don’t want to mess up, and this makes you really buckle down and try to do it a little better. I look at my own kids sometimes, and my nephews and nieces. They won’t say it around me, but I can tell that they’ve been whispering, "That’s my daddy! That’s my daddy!" That within itself is enough to make me really go out and try to do better. I try and live and be a certain way so that each day I meet a person, they can’t help but say, well, he’s just B.B. King. And that’s all.</p>
