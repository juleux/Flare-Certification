        <h1>Bukka White</h1>
        <p>Booker T. Washington White, better known as Bukka White, was born in the hills of eastern Mississippi, and was the cousin of B.B. King’s mother. He soon moved to the Delta, where as a young man, Charlie Patton inspired him to pursue a blues career. When B.B. King was very young, Bukka White, now living in Memphis, would come to visit the family when they lived in Kilmicheal, Mississippi. This might have been young B.B. King’s very first exposure to a real bluesman. When B.B. King first moved to Memphis in the summer of 1946, he lived with Bukka White. For the next ten months, Bukka schooled B.B. in the art of the blues. Bukka had prepared B.B. for his life as a bluesman by teaching him everything from how to hold his guitar to phrasing lyrics. Bukka’s most important trait which he impressed upon B.B. was his durability, and without it, B.B. King would not be who he is today.</p>
        <p>Bukka White, like Elmore James, was one of the titans of the slide guitar. The influences of both White and James can be credited towards the development of B.B. King’s excellent vibrato technique. In an interview with Guitar World magazine, B.B. recalls, "In the early years I used to hear a lot of slide guitar players. I’ve never been able to use the slide myself. So, I found that when I trill my hand, my ears tend to be fooled somewhat by that sound - as if its a person using a slide or steel guitar. I can sustain the tones, get overtones and do quite a few of the things you couldn’t do otherwise. And I’ve been doing it to this day. Though I’d have to say that I still haven’t perfected it."(3)  In Mississippi, Bukka got in some trouble with the law over a shooting scrape, and he was sentenced to a stretch in Parchman Farm State Penitentiary. While in prison, White recorded for a visiting researcher from the Library of Congress. By early 1940, Bukka was out and heading to Chicago where he had recorded before going to prison.  Blues which dared to protest Southern justice were extremely rare in 1940. Bukka’s doomy tribute to the power invested in the district attorney was a brave statement from an ex-con soon to return to the south. Bukka White’s career continued up until his death in 1977.</p>
