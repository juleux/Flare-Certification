        <h1>Lowell Fulson</h1>
        <p>Lowell Fulson is generally associated with the Texas style of blues. Actually from Tulsa, Oklahoma, he settled in the San Fransico Bay area by the time he began recording in 1946. Most of his records were in a small combo format, and he is viewed as one of the leaders in the development of comtemporary blues lead guitar. In his early years of recording, however, he occasionaly performed only with his brother Martin on second guitar, providing a deep droning country blues sound that was well complimented by his crying vocals. In 1952, B.B. King’s first real hit song, "Three O’Clock Blues," was a cover of a Lowell Fulson song (which had also done well for Fulson when he first recorded it in 1948). As was the case with B.B. King, instrumentally Fulson’s greatest influence was blues guitarist T-Bone Walker. Jimmy Rushing was the vocalist Fulson modelled himself after. Fulson achieved no real commercial success until 1950. His first hit was a recording of the Memphis Slim number "Every Day I Have the Blues," which B.B. also covered in 1956. Fulson followed "Every Day" with a string of best sellers over the next four years. The following recording was Fulson’s first after joining the Chess lineup of blues artists, and it proved to be one of his biggest hits for the company. Young Elvis Presley later also covered it, but Fulson’s version was the better seller and the better rendition.</p>
