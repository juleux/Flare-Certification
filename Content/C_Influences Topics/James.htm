        <h1>Elmore James</h1>
        <p>Elmore James was born in Richland, Mississippi in 1918. He started playing guitar in the conventional way, but probably after he heard or saw Robert Johnson, he began to develop his slide guitar style for which he is best known and imitated. He started performing in his early 20’s, by which time Robert Johnson was dead. Elmore was first recorded in the late 1940’s when he accompanied Sonny Boy Williamson for his sessions with the Trumpet recording company in Jackson, Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Although Elmore James is best known for his slide guitar, he was also an excellent single string lead guitar player. His influence on B.B. King’s soloing style can be heard in the songs, Sho Nuff I Do, Mean and Evil, Dark and Dreary.</p>
        <p>Elmore was diagnosed with a heart problem in 1946. He suffered a second heart attack in 1956 and by 1962 his health was fast deteriorating, not assisted by his frequent bouts of heavy drinking. On May 24, 1963, Elmore suffered a final heart attack and died in Chicago.</p>
